# Cipher Usability Project
Program implements the encryption and decryption algorithm using the Caesar cipher.
Created on August 24, 2022

# Purpose
* The purpose of this program is to implement a simple encryption and decryption algorithm using the Caesar cipher. The user is prompted to enter a message, a key, and whether they want to encrypt or decrypt the message. The program then shifts each character in the message by the key value and outputs the resulting message.

# What I Learned
* Caesar Cipher: I learned how to implement a basic Caesar Cipher encryption and decryption algorithm using Python.
* String manipulation: I gained experience working with strings by manipulating them using built-in Python functions such as find(), slicing, and concatenation.
* User input validation: The program requires validating user input to ensure that the message only contains allowed characters and that the key is within the valid range.
* Debugging and troubleshooting: I developed skills in identifying and fixing errors in my code using tools such as print statements and Python's built-in debugger.
* Testing and quality assurance: I conducted thorough testing and quality assurance checks to ensure that my code was working properly and efficiently, including running automated test scripts and manually testing edge cases.
* Technical documentation: I created clear and concise technical documentation for the project, including a README file that explained how to use the program, its purpose and features, and any installation or configuration requirements.
